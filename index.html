                <h3>How to set up Plubin in your server</h3>
                <p>
                    To add Plubin to your server, use this <a href="/invite/">invitation link</a> and make sure that you've given the bot all of the required permissions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's very important that Plubin has the ability to read messages in playable channels in your server. 
                    Without these permissions, 
                    Plubin will not be able to provide your server with the highest amount of Features.
                    If you want to disable Plubin's ability to respond to commands in any channel, simply remove its ability to read messages in those channels. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's all it takes! Plubin is now set up in your server and your members can begin playing as they please.
                </p>
                <p>
